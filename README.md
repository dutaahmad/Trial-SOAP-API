Certainly! Here's a sample `README.md` for your NestJS project that describes it as a SOAP API reverse proxy to REST. Feel free to adjust any details as needed.

# NestJS SOAP API Reverse Proxy

This project is a sample implementation of a SOAP API reverse proxy using NestJS. The application is designed to transform RESTful requests into SOAP requests and relay responses back to the client.

## Usage

To use this application, follow the steps below:

1. **Run the Application**

   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Start the NestJS application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   The server will start and listen on port `3000` by default.

2. **Send a SOAP Request**

   To interact with the SOAP API through the reverse proxy, make a POST request to the following endpoint:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/soap-request
   ```

   **Request Body:**

   ```json
   {
     "base_url": "https://www.dataaccess.com/webservicesserver",
     "endpoint": "NumberConversion.wso",
     "soap_action": "#POST",
     "payload": {
       "NumberToWords": {
         "ubiNum": "200"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Fields:**

   - `base_url`: The base URL of the SOAP service.
   - `endpoint`: The specific endpoint for the SOAP request.
   - `soap_action`: The SOAP action to be used.
   - `payload`: The SOAP body content structured as per the SOAP API requirements.

3. **Example Request**

   You can use a tool like Postman or cURL to send the request. For example, using cURL:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/soap-request \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
     "base_url": "https://www.dataaccess.com/webservicesserver",
     "endpoint": "NumberConversion.wso",
     "soap_action": "#POST",
     "payload": {
       "NumberToWords": {
         "ubiNum": "200"
       }
     }
   }'
   ```

4. **Handling Responses**

   The application will send the SOAP request to the specified SOAP service, and return the response from the SOAP service as JSON.

## Notes

- Ensure the SOAP service you are trying to reach is accessible from the network where this application is running.
- Adjust the `base_url`, `endpoint`, and `payload` as per the SOAP service's API specification.
